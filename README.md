# Databases
Foothill College CS31A- Intro. to Database Management Systems. This is where i'm keeping records of the code I made throughout the class for future reference. 
I took the course Fall 2018, as a high school senior, and recieved an A. 
I don't have access to all of the assignments, but the txt files show the outputs when the programs were run.
